Orchestration is crucial in DataOps, acting as the central component in the data platform and data lifecycle, as well as the software development lifecycle related to data. It coordinates numerous jobs to run efficiently and on schedule. Unlike simple schedulers like cron, orchestration engines, such as Apache Airflow, use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to manage job dependencies and timing.

## Key features of orchestration systems include:
- **High Availability:** Always online to monitor and run jobs without human intervention.
- **Job Monitoring and Alerts:** Monitors job progress, sets error conditions, and sends alerts if jobs don't complete on time.
- **Job History and Visualization:** Keeps records of job histories, supports backfilling, and visualizes job dependencies.
- **External Monitoring:** Can monitor external systems for data arrival and trigger jobs accordingly.

Historically, orchestration was mainly used by large enterprises due to the cost and complexity of available tools. Apache Oozie was popular in the 2010s but limited to Hadoop environments. Modern tools like Apache Airflow, open-sourced by Airbnb in 2014 and written in Python, have made orchestration more accessible and extensible. Other notable tools include Luigi, Conductor, Prefect, Dagster, Argo, and Metaflow, each bringing unique improvements and capabilities to orchestration.
